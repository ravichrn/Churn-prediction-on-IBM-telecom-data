# Churn-prediction-on-IBM-telecom-data

This data set provides info to help you predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs. A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their landline business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. 

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents


Shortlisting a few important variables that could affect churn:

Compute means of all x variables for churners and non-churners separately and compute the percentage difference for each variable.

Sort the variables from high to low based on percentage difference in means. The top 10 variables based on this criteria are good candidates for inclusion in the logit model as long as they are not highly correlated. 

Make sure that your data is not reduced by a large percentage (80-90%) because you have included explanatory variables in your model, that have many missing values I expect you will use most of the data.

Make sure there is no multicollinearity.
